1. Create a Zapier account at [zapier.com](https://zapier.com)
2. Create a new Zap with "Webhooks by Zapier" as the trigger
3. Choose "Catch Hook" as the trigger event
4. Copy the webhook URL provided
5. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/YOUR_ID/YOUR_KEY/
```

6. Connect the Zap to your preferred destination:
   - Email (Gmail, Outlook)
   - Google Sheets
   - CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.)
   - WhatsApp Business
   - Slack notification

### Option 2: Make.com (Integromat)

1. Sign up at [make.com](https://www.make.com)
2. Create a new scenario with "Webhooks" module
3. Copy the webhook URL

### Option 3: Custom Backend

Send leads to your own backend:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-api.com/leads
```
